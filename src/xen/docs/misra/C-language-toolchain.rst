C Dialect and Translation Assumptions for Xen
=============================================

This document specifies the C language dialect used by Xen and
the assumptions Xen makes on the translation toolchain.
It covers, in particular:

1. the used language extensions;
2. the translation limits that the translation toolchains must be able
   to accommodate;
3. the implementation-defined behaviors upon which Xen may depend.

All points are of course relevant for portability.  In addition,
programming in C is impossible without a detailed knowledge of the
implementation-defined behaviors.  For this reason, it is recommended
that Xen developers have familiarity with this document and the
documentation referenced therein.

This document needs maintenance and adaptation in the following
circumstances:

- whenever the compiler is changed or updated;
- whenever the use of a certain language extension is added or removed;
- whenever code modifications cause exceeding the stated translation limits.


Applicable C Language Standard
______________________________

Xen is written in C99 with extensions.  The relevant ISO standard is

    *ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor 3:2007*: Programming Languages - C,
    Technical Corrigendum 3.
    ISO/IEC, Geneva, Switzerland, 2007.

Translation Limits
__________________

The following table lists the translation limits that a toolchain has
to satisfy in order to translate Xen.  The numbers given are a
compromise: on the one hand, many modern compilers have very generous
limits (in several cases, the only limitation is the amount of
available memory); on the other hand we prefer setting limits that are
not too high, because compilers do not have any obligation of
diagnosing when a limit has been exceeded, and not too low, so as to
avoid frequently updating this document.  In the table, only the
limits that go beyond the minima specified by the relevant C Standard
are listed.

The table columns are as follows:

   Limit
      a terse description of the translation limit;
   Architectures
      a set relevant of Xen architectures;
   Threshold
      a value that the Xen project does not wish to exceed for that limit
      (this is typically below, often much below what the translation
      toolchain supports);
   References
      when available, references to the documentation providing evidence
      that the translation toolchain honors the threshold (and more).
