 * Architecturally, %dr{0..3} can have any arbitrary value.  However, Xen
 * can't allow the guest to breakpoint the Xen address range, so we limit the
 * guest to the lower canonical half, or above the Xen range in the higher
 * canonical half.
 *
 * Breakpoint lengths are specified to mask the low order address bits,
 * meaning all breakpoints are naturally aligned.  With %dr7, the widest
 * breakpoint is 8 bytes.  With DBEXT, the widest breakpoint is 4G.  Both of
 * the Xen boundaries have >4G alignment.
 *
 * In principle we should account for HYPERVISOR_COMPAT_VIRT_START(d), but
 * 64bit Xen has never enforced this for compat guests, and there's no problem
 * (to Xen) if the guest breakpoints it's alias of the M2P.  Skipping this
 * aspect simplifies the logic, and causes us not to reject a migrating guest
 * which operated fine on prior versions of Xen.
